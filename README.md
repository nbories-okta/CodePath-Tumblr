Tumblr - assignment 5
=======================

Objective: Basic prototyping and navigation
Hours: 9 hours - spent about 2 hours debugging a tab bar issue. Ended up that i had had created to connections to the same button so everytime u would select a new tab, it would highlight the previous button instead of the one the user should be on. Felt extremely dumb once I figured out the problem.

Walkthrough of DropBox:

Completed user stories:

* [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
* [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.
* [x] Optional: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
* [x] Optional: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.
